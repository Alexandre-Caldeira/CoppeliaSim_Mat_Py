## Project to translate Matlab to Python code

The class developed here was created to communicate
Coppelia Simulator with Matlab Software. Now, we
want to improve the code and make it available in Python.


## Lib RemoteApi

- To use the API correctly, insert on the project folder the remoteApi file compatible with the operating system: 
.dll for windows, .so linux, and .dylib for mac 

## TO-DO

1. Load the scene, try to start and pause the simulation from the code (.py) â˜‘
2. Load the mobile robot Pioneer 3DX and if possible, move it (.py)
